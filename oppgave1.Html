      <li>I like how ela plays in the game and itsvery satisfying</li>
      <li>I hate how ahses hitbox works</li>
      <li>His gadget works very well in most situations but i wont mind if they change him a bit with his lodout</li>
      <li>The has too good of a gun to be on defence. Fix that and shes fine, i do wish they gave doc the rework over a new operator</li>
      <li>Buck is very versatile and is a good operator to play if your skilled, do wish they didn't remove his nades</li>
      <li>Her cams are just too good, i wish they balaned her more</li>
      <li>He is the lord, he is very fun to play.</li>
      <li>jager just needs to get a gun switch, exept for that its fine</li>
